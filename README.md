# UNH Kaggle Covid19

This is a group for the [UNH Analytics and Data Science](https://gradschool.unh.edu/analytics) class of 2020 to work on the [Covid-19 Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

<b> Our goal</b> is to learn as much as we can from each other by sharing our progress on GitHub with the hope of being able to help out positively in the competition as well.

Although Kaggle has its own set of [10 tasks](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks) we will be focused on a different set of task each week to improve our skills. An overview of our tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/ZachZs/UNH_Kaggle_Covid19/tree/master/Weekly%20Tasks).

#### Dataset Description (from kaggle)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 47,000 scholarly articles, including over 36,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.
