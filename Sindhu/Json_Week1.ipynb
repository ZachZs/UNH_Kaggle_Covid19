Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION.

Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Discussion'}, {'text': 'The proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and ½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Discussion'}, {'text': 'One area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Discussion'}, {'text': 'For example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity.
